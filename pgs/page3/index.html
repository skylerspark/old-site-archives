    &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Hello, My name is Taylor, or perhaps people like my handle better (SkylerSpark) named after an old TV Show character. I do
    like my Job/Interest, but at my current stage as of the time of writing this, I don't have a career planned out, and I simply
    don't truly know how it will turn out. I guess I sort of have to just go on my own and try to understand things.
    <br /><br />
    &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Even though I may not have a career completely planned out, nor do I even have highschool completed, I do have my code
    to help me "get through" stress. A lot of people think of programming as... a bad thing. Some people even fear it for the sake
    of their computers. You shouldn't fear it though, coding is what makes up Everything as a whole in our lives. Ever since I was quite
    young, I always wanted to Understand computers and technology. It was always so interesting to me, and that plus my
    small mind thinking of it being magic, I guess it became a part of me.
    <br /><br />
    &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I wasn't always inept to programming though. At about the age of 6 or perhaps 7, My parents
    decided to give me a Computer. It had a lot of limitations, but I simply played games like minecraft or whatever I could find
    interesting. I would go into websites and use the "inspection" tools and change the text and whatnot. Soon after that, I understood
    Tags and Attributes (basis of HTML), and I was on my way to learning much more in the years after. By the time I reached about 10 Years of age,
    I started studying CSS (styling of html), so I started making website bases, and similar structures. It wasn't until I reached 13, that I
    finally started learning much more than just website structure.
    <br /><br />
    &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I honestly... used to Despise coding. It had a boringness that I remember as I was having trouble learning
    simple things as functions and variables in javascript. I guess my Aspergers did interfere with my "knowledge cramming", which was a
    proccess I did to learn things. It was as simple as running through the internet, and looking at every single javascript
    or canvas project I could find, and skimming through its code, seeing what I could understand, and finally writing my own
    code via a "Reader" like codepen or jsfiddle. So were close to where Im at today, its been a couple years, and I now have come
    to a point where I know many things; Html, CSS, JS, Python, Assembly, and Im also still learning a lot every day.
    <br /><br />
    &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The point Im trying to get at, well, may be I can explain it this way; Everyone learns their own way and at their own
    pace, it's up to them what they want to strive for, I just happened to love programming, music, art, and much more. I think thats
    all I can say for the moment.
