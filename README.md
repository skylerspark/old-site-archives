### Updates:

* 10/25/2019 : Updated the Contacts Page to include all my other Site Profiles and my Discord Tag
* 10/25/2019 : Even more updates today, added the About Page, and renamed the Info Page to Debug, also moved some things.
* 10/25-30/2019 : Worked on huge improvements to Responsiveness, Site now functions on EVERY SCREEN SIZE!!!! Even old gen phones!
* 10/30-11/06/2019 : Worked on more Responsiveness, made a boring but FUNCTIONAL Menu and setup to appear on ios devices. Also fixed some compatability errors, and the site should function on ios safari (all devices), Google Chrome, Firefox, Opera, and pretty much most popular browsers. Havent tested IE..
* 11/06/2019 : Over the last week, I made some Icons and Pictures, and placed them in the Projects Page, we now have 6 Projects in the projects page now.
* 11/06/2019 : Added 2 more projects (DDOVale, and CConsole) we now have 8 Projects in our projects page!
* 11/07/2019 : Random Fixes and added a Title System in the Javascript to make the page title change depending on where you are.
* 11/07/2019 : Added another project (Windows-Flat-Form-Data)
* 11/11/2019 : Added my Program logo as a favicon for the webpage, Also Deleted the old Website for specific Reasons (Im talking about the old old old site that was in the -A-Other folder)
* 11/12/2019 : Added my PGC (program graphical card) to the top left of the site, allows you to get an instant link to my github profile page, just a small shortcut thing. Source code for PGC: [SkylerSpark/Program-Graphical-Card](https://github.com/skylerspark/Program-Graphical-Card)
* 11/13-11/14/2019 : Updated styles for the "Boring" Menu from before, and removed the default styles on ios, the link now looks like the normal links, except it contains a dropdown.
* 11/15/2019 : Made the header bar Sticky, so that it stays at the top while you scroll, Im also changing some other styles, nothing major.
* 11/15/2010 : Also fixed an issue with the nav-bar that caused content to cut off near the top, it now gets cut off when its under the faded part of the top-bar, fixing the issue. Also removed all the temporary Center tags that were the backbone of the site, replaced all with css `text-align: center; display: inline-block;`.
* 11/16/2019 : Fixed another bug today, The contentCover element (The white plate that fades when you open a link) was being pushed 3 em into the roof of the site, causing it to look horrid if you scrolled down enough. Should be fixed now.
* 11/25/2019 : Fixed the README.md (This File) so it no longer contains any HTML, added a Commit Counter Badge below, to count the latest commit, Updated Social Tab with shields.io badges, which I placed in my new `SkylerSpark/Svg-Badges` Repository. Fixed some Text errors in the README, I also changed the `link()` functions onclick in the social tab, as they werent sending you to any link, and in turn not actually sending you to the site, but sending errors to the JS console.
