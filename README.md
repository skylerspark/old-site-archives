My Page is currently NOT FINISHED, but is more Stable then the old site, which couldnt run correctly in all screen sizes.

<b>Edit: Tested on Ipad and Ipad Pro, Iphone 8, and Iphone 4, all screens are sized nicely and functional. I also tested other devices with chrome's device resolution simulator, pretty much all of them seemed to work!</b>
